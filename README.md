# TBReportRedesign

In this project we have designed to facilitate the reporting of whole genome sequencing-based results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnosis, phenotyping, and epidemiologcal clustering. A manuscript describing how we arrived at this template is being submitted to PeerJ in October, 2017. We will update this document with a link to the article ? "Evidence-Based Design and Evaluation of a Whole Genome Sequencing Clinical Report for the Reference Microbiology Laboratory" ? when it comes online.
